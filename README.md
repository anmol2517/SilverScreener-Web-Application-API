# SilverScreener-Web-Application-API
To build this app, we need HTML, CSS and JavaScript. We make use of the Open Movie Database API to fetch the information.

If the input field is empty, we display the message – ‘Please Enter A Movie Name’. In case the movie entered by the user does not exist in the database, we show the message- ‘Movie Not Found’. Finally, if some error occurs while fetching the data from the API, we display the message- ‘Error Occurred.
